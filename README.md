# serial-plotter

This package provides a serial plotter as a Python replacement for the serial plotter of the Arduino IDE. It includes extra utilities, such as explicit input string formatting, plotting of a time axis (as opposed to strictly sample number), ability to data transferred over serial, and ability to start and stop streams.
